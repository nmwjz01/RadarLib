# RadarLib
This is a library used for processing radar data.I hope it can help you.
This library implements two types of functions in dynamic library.
Firstly, the conversion of various radar data formats. The supported radars are impluse,mala,ids,segy.
Second, Support algorithm processing of various data,example for removebackground,removedc, butterworth,Gain Inv Decay,signal position.
In current, these functions are implemented in C++ and run on Windows.
If there are any functions that cannot meet the needs, please let me know. mailto:nmwjz01@163.com.
On the other hand,Some algorithms use the matgpr, So you need to download the code for matgpr R2 version.
